# Bean iBeacon Demo

This app looks for any nearby iBeacons with the following ID:

* UUID: `A495DEAD-C5B1-4B44-B512-1370F02D74DE`
* Major: `BEEF`
* Minor: `CAFE`

The app displays how many iBeacons it finds and whether your device is within the iOS region for those iBeacons.

It's intended to be used with [our guide on using the LightBlue Bean as an iBeacon](https://punchthrough.com/bean/guides/features/ibeacon). You're welcome to use it as a base for your iBeacon app.
